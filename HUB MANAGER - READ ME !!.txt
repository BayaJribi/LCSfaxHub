IMPORTANT! 
To whoever it may concern:
You are now the manager of the hub data that exists in this folder.
the process is very simple. We have a folder for each category:

Knowledge Source
|
|__FrontOffice
|  |_OGV
|  |_OGT
|  |_IGV
|  |_MKT
|
|__BackOffice
|  |_F&L
|  |_TM&MXP
|  |_BD&EwA
|  |_IM
|
|__Applications
|  |_EST
|  |_OCTeam
|  |_MM
|
|__Ressource
|  |_National
|  |_AI
|		
|_AIESECShop

All you have to do , is add your file to its specific folder, and it would automatically appear in the hub :D

!!!!!!!!!!!! ATTENTION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If you wish to add an application, Please Do it in the following form : 
NameOfThePosition-ApplicantName
to ensure that it displays correctly in the hub
Example : YSF 2024 OCVP F - Baya Jribi.pdf  
The "-" ensures that the applicant names displays on the hub !
